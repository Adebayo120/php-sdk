# MCP PHP SDK

Low-level SDK implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) in PHP.

This project is a collaboration between the [PHP Foundation](https://thephp.foundation/) and the
[Symfony project](https://symfony.com/). It adopts development practices and standards from the Symfony project,
including [Coding Standards](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/standards.html) and the
[Backward Compatibility Promise](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).

Until the first major release, this SDK is considered
[experimental](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/experimental.html).
